## Your mission
Your family will be at the top of the screen, in a 5x4 grid, with slight movement back and forth. They may or may not fire at will in your direction.

You will control the ship at the bottom of the screen. The ship will be able to move left and right, and fire at your command.

Your job is to positively radiate healing energy and good vibes towards your family members. Once all members have been successfully healed, you will be rewarded with a special message.
